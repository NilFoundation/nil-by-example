## 🚀 Overview
This repository demonstrates how to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the =nil; blockchain using Hardhat and our custom plugin. The =nil; blockchain is an Ethereum Layer 2 solution based on zk-sharding, enhancing transaction efficiency and scalability.

## 📄 Features
✨ **Custom Hardhat Plugin:** Simplifies interactions between Hardhat and the nil blockchain by modifying RPC methods, handling asynchronous communications, and more.

🔧 **Smart Contract Deployment and Interaction:** Easily deploy and manage your smart contracts using Hardhat's familiar workflow.

🛠️ **Support for =nil; Wallets:** Extend your Hardhat configuration to support nil-specific wallet addresses.

## 📚 Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm/yarn installed
- An understanding of Ethereum and smart contract development

## 🔧 Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil-hardhat-example.git
   cd nil-hardhat-example
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following parameters:
```
NIL_RPC_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8529
WALLET_ADDR=0x0001111111111111111111111111111111111111
PRIVATE_KEY=3cac3b0d9297577dfac95fecdd751511446c074a039f001c04585d341423a82a
```

## 🎯 Usage
To deploy and interact with the Incrementer contract, use the following commands:
```
# Deploy the contract
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Incrementer.ts --network nil_cluster

# Interact with the contract
npx hardhat increment --network nil_cluster --contract <Contract Address>
```
